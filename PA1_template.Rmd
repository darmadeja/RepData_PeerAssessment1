```{r load_libraries}
# Loading all the R pacakges required for this excersise
library(zip)
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r load_data, echo=TRUE}
# Unzip and load the data on to an OBject
unzip("dataset.zip")
file_path <- file.path("./", "UCI HAR Dataset")
temp_data <- read.csv2("activity.csv", sep = ",")
```

```{r Raw_data_summary, echo=TRUE}
#Dimension of Raw data
dim(temp_data)

#Summary of Raw data
summary(temp_data)
```

```{r data_clean, echo=TRUE}
# Convert date field to Date class
temp_data$date <- as.Date(as.character(temp_data$date))

# remove records with NA
data <- na.omit(temp_data)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

#### 1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
```{r group_by_date, echo=TRUE}
# Group data by 'Date' and Sum up Steps by the grouping
data_by_date <- group_by(data, date)
steps_by_date <- summarise(data_by_date, sum(steps))
summary(steps_by_date)
names(steps_by_date)[2] <- "Steps"

# First 15 records of the cleaned up data
head(steps_by_date, 15)
```

#### 2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r total_steps_per_day, echo=TRUE}
# Plot for the Mean of total number of steps per day
ggplot(steps_by_date, aes(steps_by_date$Steps)) + 
geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", binwidth=1000) + 
labs(title = "Total Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency") + scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, by=1)) 
```

#### 3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r mean_median_steps, echo=TRUE}
# Mean of Steps per day
mean(steps_by_date$Steps)

# Median of Steps per day
median(steps_by_date$Steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r group_by_interval, echo=TRUE}
# Group data by 'Interval' and calculate the Average Steps by the grouping
data_by_interval <- group_by(data, interval)
steps_by_interval <- summarise(data_by_interval, mean(steps))
summary(steps_by_interval)
names(steps_by_interval)[2] <- "Steps"

# First 15 records of the cleaned up data
head(steps_by_interval, 15)
```

#### 1. Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r average_steps_by_interval, echo=TRUE}
# Plot for the Mean of total number of steps per day
ggplot(steps_by_interval, aes(interval, Steps)) + 
geom_line(color="blue") + 
labs(title = "Average Steps per Interval", x = "Steps", y = "Interval") + 
scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 2355, by=75)) + 
scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 225, by=25)) 
```

#### 2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r max_steps_by_interval, echo=TRUE}
steps_by_interval[which.max(steps_by_interval$Steps),]
```


## Imputing missing values

##### 1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
```{r no_of_NAs, echo=TRUE}
sum(is.na(temp_data$steps))
```

##### 2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.,
```{r impute_by_interval, echo=TRUE}
# Raw input data 
imputed_data <- temp_data
# Imput the missing Steps with the mean of steps by Interval 
imputed_data$steps[is.na(imputed_data$steps)] <- mean(steps_by_interval$Steps)
```

#### 3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r imputed_data, echo=TRUE}
# Summary of imputed data
summary(imputed_data)

# First 15 entries of imputed data  
head(imputed_data, 15)
```

#### 4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
```{r imputed_group_by_date, echo=TRUE}
# Group imputed data by 'Date' and Sum up Steps by the grouping
imputed_data_by_date <- group_by(imputed_data, date)
imputed_steps_by_date <- summarise(imputed_data_by_date, sum(steps))
summary(imputed_steps_by_date)
names(imputed_steps_by_date)[2] <- "Steps"

# First 15 records of the cleaned up imputed data
head(imputed_steps_by_date, 15)
```

```{r imputed_total_steps_per_day, echo=TRUE}
# Plot for the Mean of total number of steps per day of the imputed data
ggplot(imputed_steps_by_date, aes(Steps)) + 
geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", binwidth=1000) + 
labs(title = "Total Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency") + scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 20, by=1)) 
```

```{r imputed_mean_median_steps, echo=TRUE}
# Mean of Steps per day
mean(imputed_steps_by_date$Steps)

# Median of Steps per day
median(imputed_steps_by_date$Steps)
```


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
#### 1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r weekday_calc, echo=TRUE}
# create a new dataframe with day of week and the "weekend" or "weekday" type
weekday_data <- temp_data
weekday_data$day <- weekdays(weekday_data$date)
weekday_data$daytype <- ifelse(weekday_data$day == "Saturday" | weekday_data$day == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday")

# Summary of dataframe with Type of Day
summary(weekday_data)

# First 15 records of the cleaned up data with type of day in a week
head(weekday_data, 15)
```

#### 2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.
```{r weekday_steps_average}
# Group weekday data by 'interval'& 'Day-type' and Sum up Steps by the grouping
weekday_data <- na.omit(weekday_data)
weekday_data_by_interval <- group_by(weekday_data, interval, daytype)
weekday_steps_by_interval <- summarise(weekday_data_by_interval, mean(steps))
names(weekday_steps_by_interval)[3] <- "Steps"

# Summary of Average Data grouped by interval and Day-type
summary(weekday_steps_by_interval)
str(weekday_steps_by_interval)
head(weekday_steps_by_interval)


# Plot for the average of total number of steps by interval and day type (Weekday or Weekend) 
ggplot(weekday_steps_by_interval, aes(x=interval, y=Steps,color=daytype)) +  
geom_line() +
facet_grid(daytype ~.) + 
labs(title = "Average Steps per Interval", x = "Steps", y = "Interval") + 
scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 2355, by=90)) + 
scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 225, by=25)) 
```
